<h2>HOW ARE IMAGES SELECTED FOR INCLUSION IN THE MEDIA GALLERY?</h2><a href="#top">back to top</a>

<p>Attractive, well-composed, and unique photos of art, events, and ephemera from official community activities are selected from submissions to this gallery. Curators choose beautiful images that document art installations, theme camps, mutant vehicles, performances, compelling playa moments and unique perspectives. We are also seeking exceptional images from official Burning Man year-round gatherings, such as Decompression or Regional Network community events, and representations of civic projects supported by the Black Rock Arts Foundation, Burners Without Borders, and Black Rock Solar.</p>

<p>Note, even if your photos are not selected for the gallery, all submitted images are retained as a valuable part of our digital archives, and we thank you for taking the time and effort to submit your images.</p>
<a name="contribute"></a>
<h2>HOW DO I CONTRIBUTE IMAGES TO THE MEDIA GALLERY?</h2><a href="#top">back to top</a>

<p>First, read about the "<a href="#images_selected">How are images selected ...</a>" section above.</p>

<p>Second, either login in with your account information from our original image gallery, or  <a href="/register">register a new account</a> on our media gallery site, the system will then create a contributor account for you. When you log into your account, an “upload” button will be available.</p>   

<p>Next to the upload button is another button labeled “My Unsubmitted.” Clicking this button will allow you to see all your images that have been uploaded and are awaiting review. Once your images are reviewed, and possibly selected for the public gallery by our curation team, they will then show up in searches, and also under your name in the <a href="http://galleries.burningman.com/register">Contributors Directory</a>.</p>
<a name="submission"></a>
<h2>HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR MY SUBMISSIONS TO BE REVIEWED?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>Your mileage will vary and so will our availbility to review submissions.</p>
<a name="old-account"></a>
<h2>WILL MY OLD IMAGE GALLERY ACCOUNT WORK WITH THE NEW SITE?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>Yes, we have moved all user accounts from the previous site, and you should be able to login.  If not, please send your contact details to the <a heref="#support">support address listed below</a>.</p> 
<a name="resizing"></a>
<h2>DO I STILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THE HELLISH RESIZING PROCESS?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>NO! The new image gallery handles all of this for you!</p>
<a name="batch-upload"></a>
<h2>CAN I UPLOAD MORE THAN ONE PHOTO?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>Yes! Our new batch upload feature allows you to upload up to 10 images at once. When you're logged in, simply click the "upload" button, and then use the "add another" link to add additional images.  Note, you will subsequently be asked to enter meta information for each image uploaded.</p>

<a name="curated"></a>
<h2>WHY IS THE MEDIA GALLERY CURATED?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>We like to think of this gallery and the collection of items as an on-line museum. During the review and selection process, we endeavor to include as much accurate information about the subject matter as possible. In addition to being an official archive for The Burning Man Project, this is also an important communication mechanism to would-be participants, the general public and public agencies. This collection is not intended to be a photo sharing service. Yes, your campmate may be quite adorable while crashed out wearing a tutu after a late night, but we are pretty sure that you can find a few other places on the Internet to show that picture.</p>
<a name="selected"></a>
<h2>WHY DIDN'T MY PHOTO GET SELECTED FOR THE PUBLIC COLLECTION?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>First, read about the "<a hrefe="#images_selected">How are images selected ...</a>" section above.</p>

<p>There may be any number of reasons why a photo does not get selected. If your photo is out of focus, covered in dusty playa spots, haphazardly composed, contains explicit adult content, illegal activities, or subject matter not likely to be of interest to the larger community or visiting public, we will most likely not include it. In addition, an effort is made to keep the number of practically identical duplicate mages to a minimum. For example, you may have a lovely shot of The Man burning, but we may already have several similar shots already included in the gallery. It is a good idea to browse the collection and search for similar subject matter before submitting your images.</p>
<a name="video"></a>
<h2>CAN I ADD VIDEOS TO THE MEDIA GALLERY?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>While we do enjoying watching your videos on the numerous video sharing sites on the Internet, we are not accepting video submissions at this time.</p>
<a name="password"></a>
<h2>WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I LOSE MY PASSWORD?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>If you lose your password, go to the <a href="/register">login page</a>, and click the “lost password” link to reset your password.   If you forget which email you used for registration, then send your full name, and any other helpful hints to the [support-email-address] below, and we send you your registration-email-address, and from there, you can use the “lost password” link to retrieve your info.</p>

<p>Note: It is important to keep your e-mail address up to date so you can manage your photographer account.</p>
<a name="artifacts"></a>
<h2>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PLAYA ARTIFACTS SITE?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>The Playa Artifacts image archive has been merged into our new media gallery, and all artifact images are now available under the “media type” dropdown menu.</p>
<a name="scaled-small"></a>
<h2>WHY ARE THE IMAGES SCALED SO SMALL?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>In recreating the image gallery, we imported all images from the previous gallery.  The former gallery had scaled images to accommodate technical limitations that existed as part of that system. While we have no way to provide larger versions of those images, moving forward, uploaded images should be viewable at a larger size.</p>
<a name="press"></a>
<h2>I'M A MEMBER OF THE PRESS AND WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGES FOR PRESS USE?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>We do have a press image archive available, but you should first <a href="http://www.burningman.com/press/">contact the media communications team to request access</a></p>
<a name="privacy"></a>
<h2>WHAT IS THE PRIVACY POLICY WITH REGARDS TO SUBMITTED MEDIA?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>Whenever you submit expressive content to the Media Gallery, Tales from the Playa, or ePlaya, you understand that the submission will possibly be made public on the web site, and that such submission may contain personal information. The Media Gallery includes a link to each photographer and contributor's email address so that interested parties may contact them to request permission to utilize their submissions in other mediums or publications. We are not responsible for the personal information that you or others choose to post in this manner. You may be identified as the author of any posted expressive content unless you request otherwise.</p>
<a name="publication"></a>
<h2>WHAT DO I DO IF I WANT TO USE AN IMAGE HERE FOR PUBLICATION, REPRODUCTION, OR CREATIVE PURPOSES?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>

<h2>I'M A GEEK, NOT A PHOTOGRAPHER, HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE?</h2>
<a href="#top">back to top</a>
<p>This gallery software was custom written using Django and Python. There are still many features that we would like to see added. In the spirit of our gift economy, we will post this code and a task list on our <a href="http://code.burningman.com">http://code.burningman.com</a> site. You are free to reuse and enhance the code as you wish, and we hope that you’ll help gift back to the community through software contributions. You may even make a few geek and photographer friends along the way.</p>
